**I am a data scientist in the [School of Pharmacy at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.peru.pitt.edu). My work integrates full-stack programming with cultural and behavioral insights to address social issues. I develop tools ranging from descriptive analytics and statistical models to web applications. R is my primary language, though I am comfortable with Python and others. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to build human-centered solutions that balance social impact with scalable architecture. My curiosity inspires me to explore emerging technologies like large language models and contribute to open-source communities.**
