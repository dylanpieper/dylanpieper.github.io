I am a data scientist in the [School of Pharmacy](https://www.peru.pitt.edu) at the University of Pittsburgh. My work integrates data engineering and software development with cultural and behavioral insights to improve public health and criminal justice outcomes. I develop tools ranging from descriptive analytics and statistical models to web applications. R and Python are my primary languages. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to build human-centered solutions that balance social impact with scalable architecture. My curiosity inspires me to explore new technologies in machine learning and contribute to open-source communities.
