**I am a data scientist at the [Program Evaluation and Research Unit](https://www.peru.pitt.edu), University of Pittsburgh. My work combines full-stack programming and interpersonal skills to address social issues. I develop impactful tools ranging from descriptive analytics and predictive models to web applications. R is my primary language, though I am comfortable with Python and others. Using these tools, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to build solutions that balance social impact with scalable architecture. My curiosity inspires exploration of emerging technologies like large language models and contributions to open-source communities.**
