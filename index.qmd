I am a data scientist in the [School of Pharmacy](https://www.peru.pitt.edu) at the University of Pittsburgh. I engineer data science solutions that build community, improve public health, and support social change. I create impactful tools through descriptive analytics, statistical modeling, interactive mapping, and web application development using R and Python. I take a human-centered approach with cross-functional teams to balance impact with scalability. My curiosity inspires me to explore new technologies in machine learning and contribute to open-source communities.
