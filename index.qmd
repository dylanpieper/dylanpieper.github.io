**I am a data scientist at the [Program Evaluation and Research Unit](https://www.peru.pitt.edu), University of Pittsburgh. I combine my full-stack programming and interpersonal skills to address societal challenges. My work focuses on developing impactful tools from descriptive analytics and predictive models to web applications. I primarily use R but am also familiar with Python and other languages. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to build solutions that balance scalable architecture with social impact. My curiosity inspires me to explore emerging technologies like large language models and contributions to open-source communities.**
