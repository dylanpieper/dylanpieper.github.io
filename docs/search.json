    "text": "Lessons\nIt’s pretty obvious that we wouldn’t want to deploy a general health diagnosis model using LLMs just yet. But, beyond the examples, the biggest lessons I learned about LLM-powered classification were to provide minimal prompting, ask for structured responses, and ask the model for a measurement of uncertainty. I found that LLMs can understand a complex task with a simple sentence or two, and additional tokens can actually hurt performance (see Simon Couch’s blog post). What I found more useful is to define the structured data you want to receive from the LLM, such as a traditional classification probabilities for each class and a score for uncertainty. The uncertainty scores that the models provided were decently correlated with their performance and were useful for investigating edge cases. If you are going to add any additional context to your problems, I would provide the model guidance on how to handle edge cases, such as what to do when multiple classes may be accurate.\nI hope my exploration of using LLMs for classification can also help you with yours! While LLMs are a promising new technology that may help researchers and data scientists solve real-world problems, we need to approach them as we would any scientific method: with skepticism, evaluation, and validation."

In the meantime, the development of redquack will likely stall as I try to grow a community of users.\nThat said, I’m excited to share what’s new in redquack 0.3.0—a complete interface redesign that makes working with REDCap data feel more natural and tidyverse-friendly."

    "text": "What’s New in 0.3.0\n\nA Complete Interface Redesign\nThe biggest change in this release is a ground-up redesign of how you interact with your REDCap data. Instead of wrestling with low-level database operations, you now have a suite of convenience functions that make the workflow feel seamless.\nHere’s what a typical workflow looks like now:\nlibrary(redquack)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a duckdb connection\nconn &lt;- use_duckdb()\n\n# Transfer your redcap data\nredcap_to_db(\n  conn,\n  url = \"https://your-redcap-instance.edu/api/\",\n  token = keyring::key_get(\"redcap\", \"your_project\")\n)\n\n# Work with your data using familiar dplyr syntax\ndata &lt;- tbl_redcap(conn) |&gt; \n  filter(name_last == \"Nutmouse\") |&gt;\n  collect_labeled()\n\n# When you're done\nclose_duckdb(conn)\n\n\nNew Convenience Functions\nThe redesign introduces several new functions that handle common tasks:\n\nuse_duckdb() and close_duckdb() for clean connection management\ntbl_redcap() creates table references that work seamlessly with dplyr verbs\ncollect_labeled() and collect_labeled_list() apply REDCap labels and convert coded values on-the-fly\ncollect_list() splits data into instrument-specific tables\nlist_to_env() loads instruments directly into your global environment\nsave_parquet() for efficient data export when you need to share files\n\nThese functions eliminate the need to remember table names or manually apply labels—the package handles all of that for you.\n\n\nREDCap Audit Logs\nYou can now pull REDCap audit logs directly into your database with configurable date ranges:\n# get logs from the past week (default)\nlogs &lt;- redcap_log(conn)\n\n# or specify a custom date range in redcap_to_db()\nredcap_to_db(\n  conn,\n  url = \"https://your-redcap-instance.edu/api/\",\n  token = keyring::key_get(\"redcap\", \"your_project\"),\n  redcap_log_begin_date = \"2025-01-01\",\n  redcap_log_end_date = \"2025-06-30\"\n)\n\n\nBetter Labeling Control\nThe new collection functions give you fine-grained control over how REDCap labels and coded values are applied—something that was awkward in previous versions:\n# full labeling and conversion (default)\ndata &lt;- tbl_redcap(conn) |&gt; collect_labeled()\n\n# keep raw coded values\ndata &lt;- tbl_redcap(conn) |&gt; collect_labeled(convert = FALSE)\n\n# column labels only\ndata &lt;- tbl_redcap(conn) |&gt; collect_labeled(vals = FALSE)\n\n# value conversion only\ndata &lt;- tbl_redcap(conn) |&gt; collect_labeled(cols = FALSE)\n\n\nBreaking Changes\nThis redesign does introduce some breaking changes—mostly parameter renames for consistency:\n\nlogs() is now transfer_log()\nredcap_uri is now url in redcap_to_db()\nverbose is now echo with options: “all”, “progress”, or “none”\nData export formatting parameters (raw_or_label, etc.) have been removed since labeling is now handled by collection functions\n\nCheck the package website for complete migration guidance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "At the R/Medicine 2025 conference, I addressed a critical challenge in REDCap data management with the introduction of the redquack package. Traditional data extraction methods from packages like REDCapR often fail when handling large datasets.\nAt University of Pittsburgh’s School of Pharmacy, I worked on a massive longitudinal REDCap project connecting over 250 outpatient treatment centers with nearly 3 million rows across 400 columns. When I used redcap_read() to import all the data into R, it would crash my session as it exceeded my RAM. This left me unable to access our own data."

    "section": "A Database-First Solution",
    "text": "A Database-First Solution\nI solved this problem in redquack by offloading data into a local DuckDB database instead of loading it into R’s memory. Using DuckDB’s columnar storage format and a batch processing approach that extracts data in configurable chunks of record IDs, the package bypasses memory limitations entirely. You can work with datasets that far exceed your hardware’s RAM capacity while maintaining full integration with tidyverse workflows.\nUsing the redcap_to_db() function, researchers can efficiently process datasets ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000 records. The database approach means you query only the data you need and pull it into memory only when you need it, using familiar dplyr syntax.\nAdditional features make the workflow even more user-friendly:\n\nOn-the-fly conversion between raw and labeled values using REDCap metadata, eliminating the need for separate exports\nAccess to REDCap logs and transfer operation logs\nAutomatic column type optimization for fast database queries\nSound notifications (a “quack” on success) for completed transfers"
