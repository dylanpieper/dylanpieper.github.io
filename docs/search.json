    "text": "Lessons\nIt‚Äôs pretty obvious that we wouldn‚Äôt want to deploy a general health diagnosis model using LLMs just yet. But, beyond the examples, the biggest lessons I learned about LLM-powered classification were to provide minimal prompting, ask for structured responses, and ask the model for a measurement of uncertainty. I found that LLMs can understand a complex task with a simple sentence or two, and additional tokens can actually hurt performance (see Simon Couch‚Äôs blog post). What I found more useful is to define the structured data you want to receive from the LLM, such as a traditional classification probabilities for each class and a score for uncertainty. The uncertainty scores that the models provided were decently correlated with their performance and were useful for investigating edge cases. If you are going to add any additional context to your problems, I would provide the model guidance on how to handle edge cases, such as what to do when multiple classes may be accurate.\nI hope my exploration of using LLMs for classification can also help you with yours! While LLMs are a promising new technology that may help researchers and data scientists solve real-world problems, we need to approach them as we would any scientific method: with skepticism, evaluation, and validation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "At the R/Medicine 2025 conference, I addressed a critical challenge in REDCap data management with the introduction of the redquack package. Traditional data extraction methods from packages like REDCapR often fail when handling large datasets.\nAt University of Pittsburgh‚Äôs School of Pharmacy, I worked on a massive longitudinal REDCap project connecting over 250 outpatient treatment centers with nearly 3 million rows across 400 columns. When I used redcap_read() to import all the data into R, it would crash my session as it exceeded my RAM. This left me unable to access our own data."

    "text": "A Database-First Solution\nI solved this problem in redquack by offloading data into a local DuckDB database instead of loading it into R‚Äôs memory. Using DuckDB‚Äôs columnar storage format and a batch processing approach that extracts data in configurable chunks of record IDs, the package bypasses memory limitations entirely. You can work with datasets that far exceed your hardware‚Äôs RAM capacity while maintaining full integration with tidyverse workflows.\nUsing the redcap_to_db() function, researchers can efficiently process datasets ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000 records. The database approach means you query only the data you need and pull it into memory only when you need it, using familiar dplyr syntax.\nAdditional features make the workflow even more user-friendly:\n\nOn-the-fly conversion between raw and labeled values using REDCap metadata, eliminating the need for separate exports\nAccess to REDCap logs and transfer operation logs\nAutomatic column type optimization for fast database queries\nSound notifications (a ‚Äúquack‚Äù on success) for completed transfers"
