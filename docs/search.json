I received my M.A. (2020) from the University of Northern Iowa, Department of Psychology with a specialization in social psychology and statistical computing.\nMy work bridges social science, data science, and software engineering. I analyze complex data sets ranging from health records to criminal case data, while building practical business tools for staff and grant management. I develop databases and software for big data workflows, machine learning tools for data extraction and classification, and custom survey applications. My research explores the intersections of public health and cultural norms, substance use and harm reduction, and political shifts and threat management."

    "title": "redquack: An R Package for Memory Efficient REDCap-to-DB Workflows",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the R/Medicine 2025 conference, I addressed a challenge in healthcare data management with the introduction of the redquack package. Traditional REDCap data extraction using packages like REDCapR often fails when handling large datasets due to memory constraints. At the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, I work with a REDCap database containing nearly 3 million rows across 400 columns from over 200 outpatient treatment centers, creating scenarios where traditional extraction methods fail. This package solves this problem by leveraging DuckDB’s columnar storage format and implementing a batch processing approach that extracts data in configurable chunks of record IDs, bypassing memory limitations and maintaining integration with tidyverse workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the redcap_to_db() function, researchers can efficiently process datasets that exceed hardware memory capacity while preserving familiar dplyr syntax for data manipulation. Key features include automatic column type optimization across batches, comprehensive logging for progress tracking, and user-friendly elements such as sound notifications for long-running operations (a “quack” on success). This solution has proven particularly valuable for complex, multi-form projects and longitudinal studies that were previously not possible. This package represents a scalable solution that enables researchers and data scientists to harness the full potential of big REDCap data.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-NC 4.0"
